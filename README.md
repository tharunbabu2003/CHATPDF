# PDF Document Understanding with Falcon 7B and RAG

This repository contains code for a project that uses an open-source model called Falcon 7B and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to understand PDF documents and answer questions based on the document content.

## Project Overview

1. **PDF Document Understanding**: The Falcon 7B model is used to parse and understand the content of the PDF documents.

2. **Question Answering**: The RAG model is then used to answer questions based on the understood content of the PDF documents.
